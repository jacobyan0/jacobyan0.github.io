My work focuses on using data science and artificial intelligence (machine learning) to make transportation more equitable, sustainable, and accessible. Trained in urban planning, computational methods, and transportation engineering, I bring an interdisciplinary perspective to urban science (especially transportation research) that connects technological innovations with community needs. I work closely with public agencies and industry partners to develop decision-support tools to help them better plan for and manage innovative shared mobility options such as ridehailing and shared e-scooters and e-bikes. My recent projects aim to develop and evaluate strategies and policies to facilitate the integration between public transit and shared mobility.
