I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Engineering School of Sustainable Infrastructure and Environment at the University of Florida. My work focuses on using data science and artificial intelligence (machine learning) to make transportation more equitable, sustainable, and accessible. Trained in urban planning, computational methods, and transportation engineering, I bring an interdisciplinary perspective to urban science (especially transportation research) that connects technological innovations with community needs. I work closely with public agencies and industry partners to develop decision-support tools to help them better plan for and manage innovative shared mobility options such as ridehailing and shared e-scooters and e-bikes. My recent projects aim to develop and evaluate strategies and policies to facilitate the integration between public transit and shared mobility.
