Our mission centers on the innovative and thoughtful application of data science and artificial intelligence make transportation more equitable and sustainable. Bridging transportation engineering, data science, and urban planning, we take an interdisciplinary approach to transportation research that connects technological innovations with community needs. We work closely with public agencies and industry partners to develop intelligent decision-support tools that can help them better plan for and manage public transit systems and new mobility services (e.g., ridesharing, bike-sharing, and scooter-sharing).

## The Annual Research-to-Practice Transit Symsposium

Since 2020, I have co-lead (with California Department of Transportation) the organization of the Annual Research-to-Practice Transit Symsposium, in collaboration with many other partners such as APTA, the Mineta Transportation Institute, and UC Davis. The symposium provides a platform where transit researchers and practitioners share insights on how evidence-based research is used to inform transit planning and operations. The event is live-streamed on Youtube and accessible to the public at no cost. It attracts hundreds of participants annually, with the number consistently increasing each year.
