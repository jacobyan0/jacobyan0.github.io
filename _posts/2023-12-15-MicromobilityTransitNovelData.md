11 Spin post-ride survey dataset) that records thousands of transit-connecting shared e-scooter trips in Washington DC. This unique dataset allows us to address some critical research gaps in prior research on transit and micromobility integration. Specifically, we used the dataset to reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of transit-connecting shared e-scooter trips in Washington DC and to validate the buffer-zone approach commonly used in prior research to infer transit-connecting micromobility trips.
