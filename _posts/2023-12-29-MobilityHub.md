Beginning with a GIS-based methodology, we identify hub locations by prioritizing factors such as transit availability, accessibility, and equity. The tool, available on GitHub, utilizes publicly accessible datasets, ensuring its versatility for diverse regions. To refine these locations, we then integrate citizen input through a survey focused on multimodal travel and opinions on the identified hubs. This collaborative approach optimizes GIS-identified hub locations. In a case study for Gainesville, Florida, we identified mobility hubs at neighborhood, district, and regional levels, and we're extending the application to West Palm Beach. 

*Key words: mobility hub, multimodal travel, public transit*
