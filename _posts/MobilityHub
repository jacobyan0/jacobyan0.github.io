Results suggested that the service areas of the three modes largely overlap, and most e-scooter trips could have been made by transit or bikeshare. In addition, we found that e-scooters enhance mobility services for some underserved neighborhoods. Before COVID-19, about 10% of all e-scooter trips were taken to connect with the Metrorail system
