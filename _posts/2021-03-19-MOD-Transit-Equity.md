This paper evaluates traveler preferences for a proposed integrated transit system versus the existing fixed-route system, with a particular focus on disadvantaged travelers. Results from low-income communties in Detroit and Ypsilanti suggest that a majority of survey respondents preferred a MOD transit system over a fixed-route one. However, some women may have safety concerns, and  low technology self-efficacy can be a more serious barrier for many people to adopt MOD transit.
