I worked with a few Master of Computer Science students at UF to develop a crowdsourcing platform [[watch a 3-min demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4ABfMFuq9g) that have two main functions]: 

1) It allows residents to report micromobility-related safety incidents (i.e., crashes and near-misses).

2) It allows city transportation staff to conduct analytics regarding e-scooter parking and usage patterns.
