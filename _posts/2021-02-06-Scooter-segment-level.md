We analyze trip origins and destinations for shared e-scooter use at the street-segment level. Results show that street segments near tourist sites, hotels, and transit stops attract the most scooter-trip destinations. In constrast, the supply of available e-scooters is the dominant force shaping scooter-trip origins
