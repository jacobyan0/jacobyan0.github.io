We propose an analytical framework to examine how dockless e-scooter and station-based bikesharing differ regarding a set of equity-related outcomes (i.e., availability, accessibility, usage, and idle time) across neighborhoods in different socioeconomic categories. An analysis of idle time is made possible by the availability of the GBFS data, a new source of open big data. The analysis of idle time can shed light on if improving spatial access to shared micromobility vechicles in low-income communities can effectively promote micromobility use in these areas.
