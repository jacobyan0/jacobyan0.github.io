An analysis of idle time is made possible by the availability of the GBFS data, a new source of open big data. The analysis of idle time can shed light on if improving spatial access to shared micromobility vechicles in low-income communities can effectively promote micromobility use in these areas.

*Key words: E-scooter, bikeshare, micromobility equity*
