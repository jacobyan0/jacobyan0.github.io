* About me:"index.md"

* Publications: "Publications.md"

* Project Portfolio: the markdown files in the "posts" folder. To turn off "read more", go to the includes folder, find home.html, delete the "<div ...read more..." line

    * detailed Jekyllrb guide on posts: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/
    * Make good use of excerpt_separator
      
    ![excerpt_separator](https://github.com/jacobyan0/jacobyan0.github.io/raw/master/images/Other/Excerpt_separator.png)

* Teaching: "teaching.md"

* Media: "Media.md"

* News: "News.md"

* Note1: Layout of all pages should be "page" except for posts
* Note2: all the content of a layout html is "included" when displayed the web page. So "layout" works more like "out-include" (i.e., content & include stuff in layout) and "includes" works more like "inner-include" (i.e., include stuff in include/xx.html file + other content of the html in development)


* Use Jekyllrb server for testing of web pages
