## Come to work with us!

The Just\&Green Transportation Lab is recruiting 1-2 fully-funded PhD students and multiple temporary research assistants to join our team in the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida (ranked a Top 5 public university by US News). Qualified candidates should have solid data analysis and programming (Python or R) skills and a strong interest in applying these skills to understand and solve transportation and urban issues. Students with solid training in statistics/econometrics, machine learning, and GIS are especially encouraged to apply. We welcome students from various educational backgrounds, including but not limited to, civil/transportation engineering, urban planning, geography, computer science, and statistics.

The successful candidates are expected to study one of the following topics:
•	Promoting equitable AI applications in transportation
•	Multimodal transportation (e.g., public transit, shared mobility, and shared micromobility)
•	Spatial accessibility to essential destinations such as jobs, food, and healthcare

The successful candidates will work as graduate research assistants in our lab. We provide a highly competitive stipend and opportunities to collaborate with leading researchers around the world.
The Just\&Green Transportation Lab is led by Dr. Xiang 'Jacob' Yan (https://jacobyan0.github.io/), Assistant Professor in Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida. To express your interest in joining the team, please email your CV, a short cover letter, and a writing sample (at least one page) to Dr. Xiang 'Jacob' Yan (xiangyan@ufl.edu).
