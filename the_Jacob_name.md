title: "Why I prefer to be called Jacob"

Over the years, many people have asked me how to prounce "Xiang" so that they can call me by my real name. Some folks said that they felt bad for not being able to prounce my name properly, including a great YouTuber Ray Delahanty that I really admire (see image below). If you are one of these well-meaning people or have ever wondered if you should call me by "Xiang" or "Jacob," here is a post to explain why "**Jacob**" is my prefered name.

## **The short answer** ##

The short answer is that Jacob works better for me in professional and daily interactions. This is because people who do not speak Mandarine prounce my official first name (Xiang) very differently from the original sound, which sometimes made me not realize that I was called upon.

## **The cultural reason** ##
My official name is 严（Yan）翔(Xiang). In the Chinese culture, people with one character for their first name is usually called by their full name, and only in rare cases such as writing to an intimate friend would they be addressed by their one-character first name. Therefore, when I was an exchange student to Hong Kong in 2011, I worked with a close friend from Austrialia to pick the name "Jacob" for me (He said that it is the fist name that came to his mind based on his impression of me, and I liked it).
