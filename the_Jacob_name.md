If you've ever wondered whether to call me "Xiang" or "Jacob," this post explains why I prefer Jacob.

Over the years, many people have asked me how to pronounce "Xiang" so they can call me by my real name. Some have even expressed feeling bad for not getting it quite right (I also apologize when I mispronounce others' names!). I decided to make this post when I saw Ray Delahanty, a YouTuber I really admire, noted the following when refering to my work:

## **The short answer** ##

I prefer "Jacob" because it works better for me in professional and daily interactions. Since Mandarin pronunciation of my given name, "Xiang," is quite different from how non-Mandarin speakers typically say it, I sometimes don’t realize I’m being addressed.

## **The cultural reason** ##
My full name is 严 (Yan) 翔 (Xiang). In Chinese culture, people with a single-character given name are usually addressed by their full name. Using just the given name is rare and typically reserved for close friends in informal settings.

When I was an exchange student in Hong Kong in 2011, a close Australian friend helped me choose an English name. He suggested "Jacob" because it was the first name that came to his mind based on his impression of me, and I liked it—so it stuck!
